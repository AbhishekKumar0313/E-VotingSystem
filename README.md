# E-VotingSystem
## I have created a E-voting system using only c++.
### I have used file handling,classes,objects, loops and conditionals .
### In this E-voting system :-
#### . you have to first register your district.
#### . you can login to admin to see your district details.
#### . you have to insert data of all candidate through candidate login portal.
#### . you can vote by "vote" option.
#### . once voting completed , result will be out instantly.
#### . it takes almost 1 day to complete , it is still not fully functional.
